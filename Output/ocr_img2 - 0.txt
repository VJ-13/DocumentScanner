DOCUMENT SCANNER

This project utilizes OpenCV to implement a document-scanning
application. It includes various image processing techniques such as
thresholding and edge detection to identify the document boundaries
accurately. The code captures images from a webcam or loads an image
from a file, and then applies image processing operations to detect and
extract the document. The detected document is then warped to a top-

down view using a perspective transformation. The final image can be
saved and has OCR text for it.

To run the program, you need:

Python

OpenCv

NumPy

Imutils and SciPy
Pytesseract
