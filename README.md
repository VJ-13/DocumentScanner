# DocumentScanner

This project utilizes OpenCV to implement a document-scanning application. It includes various image processing techniques such as thresholding and edge detection to identify the document boundaries accurately. The code captures images from a webcam or loads an image from a file, and then applies image processing operations to detect and extract the document. The detected document is then warped to a top-down view using a perspective transformation. The user can press 's' to save the image, press 'o' to get the OCR of the image and press 'Esc' to quit the program. 

To run the program, you need: \\
•	Python \\
•	OpenCV \\
•	NumPy \\
•	Imutils and SciPy \\
•	Pytesseract \\
