“You mean the moment J picture a new baseball glove, candy and
toys, that’s like a carrot to a donkey?” Mike asked.

“Yes, and as you get older, your toys get more expensive — a new
car, a boat, and a big house to impress your friends,” said rich dad
with a smile. “Fear pushes you out the door, and desire calls to you.

can thrive and flourish,” said rich dad. “Unfortunately, for many people
School is the end, not the beginning.” .

There was a long silence. Rich dad was smiling. I didn't
comprehend everything he said that day. But as with most great
teachers, his words continued to teach for years.
