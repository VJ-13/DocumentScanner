This project utilizes OpenCV to implement a document-scanning application. It includes various image processing techniques such as thresholding and edge detection to identify the document boundaries accurately. The code captures images from a webcam or loads an image from a file, and then applies image processing operations to detect and extract the document. The detected document is then warped to a top-down view using a perspective transformation. The user can press 's' to save the image, press 'o' to get the OCR of the image and press 'Esc' to quit the program.
